Defect Measurement and Analysis

QA in Software Processes:
	Mega-process:initiation, development, maintenance, termination;
	Development process components:requirement, specification, design, coding, testing, release.
	Process variations;
	
	QA important in all processes.


QA in Waterfall Process:
	defect prevention in early phases
	focused defect removal in testing phase
	defect containment in late phases
	phase transitions: inspection/review/etc.

QA in Software Processes:
	Process variations (not waterfall) and QA;
	QA in maintenance processes;
	QA scattered throughout all processes.

verification/validation (V&V) view

V&V in Software Process:
	customer requirements-->product specifications-->high-level design-->low-level design-->coding & unit test: implementation (& V&V);
	coding & unit test-->component test-->integration test-->system test-->operational use: testing (& V&V);
	user@top vs. developer@bottom;

V&V vs DC View:
	Two views of QA;
	Mapping between V&V and DC view;







Chapter 5. Quality Engineering


QA to SQE:
	QA activities need additional support;
	Assessment of quality/reliability/etc;
	QA + above=>software quality engineering (SQE);

SQE Process

SQE and QIP(quality improvement paradigm)

Pre-QA Planning:
	Pre-QA planning: Quality goal, Overall QA strategy;
	Setting quality goal(s).

Setting Quality Goals:
	Identify quality views/attributes;
	Select direct quality measurements;
	Assess quality expectations vs. cost.

Forming QA Strategy
	QA activity planning;
	Measurement/feedback planning;

Analysis and Feedback
	Measurement;
	Analyses: quality/other models;
	Feedback and followup.

SQE in Software Processes:
	SQE activities (cid:26) development activities;
	Fitting SQE in software processes.

SQE in Waterfall Process

SQE Effort Profile:
	QE activity/effort distribution/dynamics;
	planning: front heavy;
	QA: activity mix(early vs. late; peak variability? deadline?);
	analysis/feedback: tail heavy(often deadline-driven or decision-driven).

SQE Effort in Waterfall Process







Chapter 6. Testing Overview


Testing and QA Alternatives:
	Defect prevention.

Error blocking and error source removal:
	Defect removal;
	Defect containment: Fault tolerance and failure containment (safety assurance).

QA and Testing:
	Testing as part of QA;
	Testing: Key questions.

Testing: Why?:
	Original purpose: demonstration of proper behavior or quality demonstration.~ "testing" in traditional settings;
	New purpose: defect detection & removal.

Testing: How:
	How? Run-observe-followup(particularly in case of failure observations);
	Refinement.

Testing: Activities & Generic Process:
	Major testing activities;
	Link above activities ) generic process;

Testing: Planning and Preparation:
	Test planning;
	Test preparation.

Testing: Execution:
	General steps in test execution;
	Key to execution: handling both normal vs. abnormal cases;
	Activities closely related to execution.

Testing: Analysis and Followup:
	Analysis of testing results;
	Followup activities
	
Testing: How?:
	How to test? -refine into three sets of questions: basic questions, testing technique questions, activity/management questions.

Testing Technique Questions:
	Testing technique questions;
	Testing model questions.

Test Activity/Management Questions:
	Addressed already: Generic process and relation to QA and software processes;
	Other activity/management questions.

Functional vs. Structural Testing:
	Key distinction: Perspective on what need to be checked/tested;
	Functional testing;
	Structural testing.
	
Black-Box vs. White-Box View:
	Object abstraction/representation;
	Gray-box (mixed black-box/white-box) testing.

White-box Testing:
	Program component/structure knowledge;
	Applicability;
	Criterion for stopping.

Black-box Testing:
	Input/output behavior;
	Applicability;
	Criteria: when to stop.

When to Stop Testing:
	Resource-based criteria;
	Quality-based criteria.
	
Usage-Based Testing and OP:
	Usage-based statistical testing;
	Applicability;
	Termination criteria: reliability goals.

Coverage-Based Testing:
	Coverage-based testing;
	Applicability;
	Termination criteria: coverage goals.
