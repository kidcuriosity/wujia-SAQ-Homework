    The most intuition way of SQA is software testing. The purpose of software testing is to detect errors in the software. The tester should ideally detect all errors before the software is released to the customer. However, full test coverage of a program is impossible. Software testing is a trade-off between budget, time and quality. Here are six functional tests to ensure software quality.

#####Unit Testing
    Unit testing is the process of testing each unit of code in a single component. This form of testing is carried out by the developer as the component is being developed. The developer is responsible for ensuring that each detail of the implementation is logically correct.

#####Functional Testing
    Functional testing addresses concerns surrounding the correct implementation of functional requirements. Commonly referred to as black box testing, this type of testing requires no knowledge of the underlying implementation.
Functional test suites are created from requirement use cases, with each scenario becoming a functional test. As a component is implemented, the respective functional test is applied to it after it has been unit tested.For many projects, it is unreasonable to test every functional aspect of the software. Instead, define functional testing goals that are appropriate for the project. Prioritize critical and widely used functions and include other functions as time and resources permit.

#####System Testing
    System testing executes end-to-end functional tests that cross software units, helping to realize the goal of ensuring that components combine to deliver the desired business result. In defining the project's system testing goals, focus on those scenarios that require critical units to integrate.

#####Regression Testing
    Regression testing ensures code modifications have not inadvertently introduced bugs into the system or changed existing functionality. Goals for regression testing should include plans from the original unit, as well as functional and system tests phases to demonstrate that existing functionality behaves as intended.

#####System Integration Testing
    System integration testing is a process that assesses the software's interoperability and cooperation with other applications. Define testing goals that will exercise required communication. (It is fruitless to test interaction between systems that will not collaborate once the developed system is installed.) This is done using process flows that encapsulate the entire system.

#####Acceptance Testing
    Acceptance testing aims to test how well users interact with the system, that it does what they expect and is easy to use. Although it is the final phase of testing before software deployment, the tests themselves should be defined as early as possible in the SDLC. Early definition ensures customer expectations are set appropriately and confirms for designers that what they are building will satisfy the end user's requirements. To that end, acceptance test cases are developed from user requirements and are validated in conjunction with actual end users of the system. The process results in acceptance or rejection of the final product.
