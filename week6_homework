Testing vs. Formal verification

    Tesing is important link in development process
   
    Defect situations: Medium/low vs Low/no

    Cost: moderate vs hight

    Different development phases
    
Testing vs. Preventive actions

    Different applicability to maintenance
    
    Objects QA activities applied on different things: executable code vs dev. activities

    Different development phases: testing phase and later vs defect prevention on (req/spec/design/coding)

    General expertise levels: low vs high

    Problem or defect types:dynamic failures & related faults VS. negating causes or pre-conditions to pervasive problems

Testing vs. Inspection
    
    Existence of the implemented product
    
    Levels of quality/defects
    
    Static vs. dynamic defects

    Localized vs. interconnected defects

    Combined approaches
    
    Phases and transitions
    
    Inspection of testing entities/processes
